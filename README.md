- 👋 Hi, I’m @damirkarisik
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis.
- 🌱 After a decade of working various roles in PR/Marketing/Food Biz I decided to make a big career change into the Digital Sector 💻. In 2023 I got a spot at the [DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/en/) school 📚 and completed their comprehensive Data Analysis programme 📊. It wasn't easy, learning programming from scratch 🧑‍🏫, adopting an analytical mindset, understanding all the different tools 🛠️... but I did it! I successfully completed the final project and realized this was the right career path for me.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on expanding my portfolio and landing my first Data Analyst gig to work statistical magic for a company in need of my unique perspective. ✨

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have released countless music projects, with my band, as an eclectic artist and a music producer. On my latest project [karinho](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7CCsMWecCpH7WfqNviwQqn?si=eApMjr66SuuDN78AgUImMQ), I did everything myself: writing, recording, mixing, mastering; it's truly my magnum opus 😄
